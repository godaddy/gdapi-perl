Release 0.02 - 9th January 2014
 - Returned values from some APIs are not always resources.
   Sometimes they are raw strings, null, integers etc.  Methods
   were added to the Resource class so that you can get at the
   decoded json directly (see the Resource->data method)
 - If 'schemas' link is missing in a resource, it falls back
   on the client base URL and concatenation "/schemas"

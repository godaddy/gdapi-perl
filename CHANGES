Release 0.03 - 13th January 2014
 - ability to register Resource subclasses that will be
   used as the implemented subclass for a given schema
   type.

Release 0.02 - 9th January 2014
 - f_as_resources method added
 - Returned values from some APIs are not always resources.
   Sometimes they are raw strings, null, integers etc.  Methods
   were added to the Resource class so that you can get at the
   decoded json directly (see the Resource->data method)
 - If 'schemas' link is missing in a resource, it falls back
   on the client base URL and concatenation "/schemas"
 - Honor the X-API-Schemas header
 - Honor the raise_http_errors flag when fetching the schemas
